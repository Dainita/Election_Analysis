## Election Analysis Summary
This Election Analysis presents the election results in an easily read format and clearly identifies the election winner. The script developed for this analysis provides a standard format that can also be used for other elections. Minor modifications to the script will yield results of election data presented in a csv file. The load file will need to be updated to read a different election data file. It would need to be confirmed that the file has a header row and that the variables and variable positions match. Just a few simple updates and the new election data analysis is complete.
